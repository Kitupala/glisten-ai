# Glisten.ai

This dark website was build with [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/), [Prismic](https://prismic.io/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [GSAP](https://gsap.com/) and TypeScript.


YouTube tutorial course (by Alex Trost) main goal was to learn how to use Next.js, the leading React framework, as well as Prismic, a CMS that gives you a Headless Page Builder. Used GSAP to add animations to the site, both on page load and on scroll. Also used Tailwind CSS to style the super polished website.

### Edit content models with Slice Machine

This project includes an application called Slice Machine, which generates models for your Custom Types and Slices. Slice Machine stores the models locally in your codebase, so you can save and version them. It also syncs your models to Prismic. To learn how to use Slice Machine, read [Model Content in Next.js](https://prismic.io/docs/technologies/model-content-nextjs).
